# About Me 
I am a doctoral student in the Information School at the University of Washington advised by Dr. Jin Ha Lee. I am also a member of the UW Gamer Group and the Digital Youth Lab. In the broadest sense, my research interests include knowledge organization and preservation of interactive/multimedia, music information retrieval, and computational creativity.   

Currently, my work looks at the potential of online, fan-generated content for the long-term preservation of video games and the way artificial intelligence is impacting the creativity of composers and children.
